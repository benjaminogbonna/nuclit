Nuclear physics is the branch of physics that studies the atomic nucleus, its components (protons and neutrons), and the forces that govern them. This field explores phenomena like radioactive decay, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion, and has applications in energy, medicine, and weapons. It is distinct from atomic physics, which focuses on the atom as a whole including its electrons
